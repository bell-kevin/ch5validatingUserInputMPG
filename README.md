# ch5validatingUserInputMPG
Create a program to calculate miles per gallon. Ask the user for miles and gallons, validate that input, and allow the user to calculate MPG multiple times.  The user must enter a number of miles traveled that is at least 100.0 miles, but not more than 500.0. If the user does not enter a valid value for miles, use a loop to keep asking the question until a good value is entered.  Then the user must enter a number of gallons used that is at least 1.0 gallon but not more than 50.0 gallons. If the user does not enter a valid value for gallons, use a loop to keep asking the question until a good value is entered.  Calculate the MPG only after the input for both values is valid.
