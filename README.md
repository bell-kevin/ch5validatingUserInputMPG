# ch5validatingUserInputMPG

Create a program to calculate miles per gallon. Ask the user for miles and gallons, validate that input, and allow the user to calculate MPG multiple times.

The user must enter a number of miles traveled that is at least 100.0 miles, but not more than 500.0. If the user does not enter a valid value for miles, use a loop to keep asking the question until a good value is entered.

Then the user must enter a number of gallons used that is at least 1.0 gallon but not more than 50.0 gallons. If the user does not enter a valid value for gallons, use a loop to keep asking the question until a good value is entered.

Calculate the MPG only after the input for both values is valid.

Do all this inside of a loop that asks the user if they want to calculate another MPG. That is, after the first calculation of MPG, ask the user if they want to calculate another MPG; if they respond with "yes" or "y", then repeat the process, and only if they respond with "no" or "n", end the program. You may choose if the valid inputs for this question are the words "yes" or "no" or the single characters "y" or "n". Which do you think a user would prefer?

Run the program and test all the scenarios. This will require testing a miles value that is too low and another that is too high, and testing a gallons value that is too low and another that is too high. Take screenshot(s) showing your testing of all of these scenarios.

Here is an example showing a good set of input and bad input to test the values:

NOTE: Remember the requirements for a header and a pause at the end of the program, discussed in the reading "Console Applications". These are required in every console application project.

Submission: Submit a single zipped folder containing all of the specified screenshots AND the root folder for the project.

== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project. I have a [website](https://bellKevin.me) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign 
from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not 
a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
email me at **bellKevin@pm.me** for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
